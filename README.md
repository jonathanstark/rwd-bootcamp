## [Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3220)

In this hands-on webcast presented by Jonathan Stark, author of 'Building Android Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript' and 'Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript', you'll learn why it is no longer safe to assume that visitors to your website are sitting in front of large monitors equipped with a keyboard and mouse. As smartphones overtake the desktop as the primary portal to the Web - and as new device types and interaction models continue to emerge - designers need to adopt future-friendly strategies that support a full range of user contexts with a single codebase.

### What will be covered?

The "One Web" philosophy and benefits
Mechanics of media queries
Code organization and best practices
Adding support for adaptive images
Fallback techniques for older browsers
Who is this webcast for?

This webcast is for web designers and developers who are interested in creating mobile web sites and web apps. A working familiarity with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be very helpful but is not required.
